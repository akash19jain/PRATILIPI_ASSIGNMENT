Some Features of the Assignment:
1) The `/stories` page cannot be accessed until the user is logged in.
2) The `/home` page is the page from where the user can log in.
3) The `/register` is the page from where a new user can register.
4) Clicking on the tile of a story or the read more button takes you to the full story where you can view the Full Story along with the number of unique visitors for the story.
5) Appropraite messages are being displayed if the user enters invalid credentials while logging or registring.
6) The `logout` button takes you back to the `/home` page from where a user can log back.

Currently only one user has been registered whose credentials are as followed:<br>
